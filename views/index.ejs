                        Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 â€“ March 9, 1997), better known by his stage
                        names
                        the Notorious B.I.G.,
                        Biggie Smalls, or simply Biggie,[1] was an American rapper and songwriter. Rooted in the New
                        York
                        rap scene and gangsta rap traditions,
                        he is considered one of the greatest rappers of all time.[2] Wallace became known for his
                        distinctive laidback lyrical delivery, offsetting the lyrics' often grim content.
                        His music was often semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality, but also of
                        debauchery and celebration.<br>
                        And this is a snippet from one of his best singles so far called the 'Juicy'...
